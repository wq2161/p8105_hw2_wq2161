## Problem 1

### Part 1

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet.

``` r
trash_wheel_df = read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N535")

trash_wheel_df =
  trash_wheel_df %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls))

trash_wheel_df
```

### Part 2

Read and clean precipitation data for 2018 and 2019.

``` r
prcp_2018 = read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", sheet = "2018 Precipitation", range = "A2:B15")

prcp_2018 =
  prcp_2018 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month, total) %>%
  mutate(year = "2018") %>%
  relocate(year)

prcp_2019 = read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", sheet = "2019 Precipitation", range = "A2:B15")

prcp_2019 =
  prcp_2019 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month, total) %>%
  mutate(year = "2019") %>%
  relocate(year)
```

Combine precipitation datasets and convert month to a character
variable.

``` r
prcp_2018_2019 = 
  bind_rows(prcp_2018, prcp_2019) %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[month])

prcp_2018_2019
```

    ## # A tibble: 24 × 3
    ##    year  month     total
    ##    <chr> <chr>     <dbl>
    ##  1 2018  January    0.94
    ##  2 2018  February   4.8 
    ##  3 2018  March      2.69
    ##  4 2018  April      4.69
    ##  5 2018  May        9.27
    ##  6 2018  June       4.77
    ##  7 2018  July      10.2 
    ##  8 2018  August     6.45
    ##  9 2018  September 10.5 
    ## 10 2018  October    2.12
    ## # … with 14 more rows

### Part 3

The datasets are collected by *Mr. Trash Wheel*. They are under the
background of “a water-wheel vessel that removes trash from the Inner
Harbor in Baltimore, Maryland.” The trash\_wheel\_df dataset contains 14
variables and 454 observations. It includes information on dumpster,
month, year, date, weight\_tons, volume\_cubic\_yards, plastic\_bottles,
polystyrene, cigarette\_butts, glass\_bottles, grocery\_bags,
chip\_bags, sports\_balls, homes\_powered. The prcp\_2018\_2019 dataset
is the combination of the total precipitation amounts by month in 2018
and 2019. The variables are year, month, total. It contains 24
observations. The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33. The median
number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2019 is 9.
